### Project description    
The program finds the number conceived by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?    
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**  
- The computer thinks of an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" it means "write a program that guesses a number."
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.
- Write your own function that guesses in less than 20 tries.

**Quality metric**     
Results are measured by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**     
Learning to write good python code.


### Data Brief
This code does not work with dataset.

### Stages of work on a project  
1. Learning the 'PYTHON-8. Tools for Data Science' module at SkillFactory platform.
2. Development of a program for the final task.
3. Testing and improving desing of the soure code.
4. Registration of the project at github according to the requirements.

### Results:  
The code showed a result that satisfies the conditions.
The average number of attempts is 8, less than 20.
The algorithm for shifting the boundaries of the number generation range has been applied.

### Conclusions:  
Got the basic skills:
- working with IDE VScode
- synchronize project repository on github.com
- design of project description files
